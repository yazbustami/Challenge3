few things I took into considertaion :
    figure out what *characters* are needed
    min & max # of characters
    included concat(s) to join arrays together


During this challenge I learned how auto-generated passwords work, and how the passwords even came to be. Signing up for accounts, becoming part of a compant, or even joining a workforce can have companies provide "auto" generated passwords like this. So being able to create this, made alot of sense as to why and how.
